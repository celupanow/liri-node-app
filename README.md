# liri-node-app
This is a node app that uses the Command Line to search for various information from several different APIs.

No working link because there is no actual HTML or interactive DOM.

## Objectives

 - Use a node Spotify api package to search the Spotify API.
 - Use axios to call the OMDB API and the Bands In Town API.
 - Depending on the command entered, display information from the Bands In Town API, Spotify API, or OMDB API.
 - Use a separate js file for the keys needed to call the Spotify API.
 - Use a txt file for a command that reads the txt file and follows whatever command and search term is in the txt file.
 
## How It Works
The user must put two items into the command line. The first one is a command. The options are "concert-this", which will search the Band In Town

## Technologies
